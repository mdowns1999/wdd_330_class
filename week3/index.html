        <ul>
            <li>See Reading examples down in the exercise section.  
                I mainly tried out the exercises for myself instead of just writing about them.</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h2>Questions:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>In the reading I exerimented with the this pointer (I assume).  I went over th earticle and experimented with it a few times.
                However, is the this kinda like a thing we would use in a Class?  In Python we would use the self. thing to refer to a variable within the object.  I was wondering if the this. thing acts the same way.
            </li>
        </ul>
