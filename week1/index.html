        <p>The screenshot down below is the function I made for one of the Javascript Exercises.  I checked the 
            type of value that goes into the function, then I output what the type is.  If you would like to play around with 
            the function, go under the folder week1, then under the js folder, then click on the week1 Javascript file.
        </p>
