        <h2> Purpose:</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this project will be display a 5 day weather forecaast for any visitors that might come by.
            The site will hopefully have a feature where you can lookup a few other cities or towns and see their five
            day forecast. The hope is to have a desgin that is clean and easy for the user to get the information they
            need as quick as possible.</p>

        <h2>Data Sources</h2>
        <p>For this project, we will use an API from openweathermap.org. This site has API's you can use for free. For
            local JSON files, I will create a JSON file that will contain different links and names of cities that you
            can view their weather. I will then use Local storage to remember which link (forecast) the user was on so
            if they return to that page, they can pick up where they left off.</p>
