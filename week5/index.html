        <h2>Notes:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The three common errors are: Sustem error, Porgrammer Error, and User Error</li>
            <li>Warnings will still let the program run, but the program can still be incorrect.</li>
            <li>Test your code incase silent errors that are not flagged may still be lurking. Even though Javascript is
                a forgiving language, always strive to have good sytax and readability.</li>
            <li>Use 'use strict'; at the top of your JS file to help revent mistakes</li>
            <li>You could use <a href="https://www.jslint.com/">JS Lint</a>, <a href="https://jshint.com/">JSHint</a> or
                <a href="https://eslint.org/">ES Hint</a> to check you JS code.</li>
            <li>You can use alerts as breakpoints to check values</li>
            <li>The keyword 'debugger' will run the debugger in the source/console tabs.</li>
            <li>Try and catch statments are a good way to catch mistakes that may arise</li>

            <p>NOTE: I do have coding exmples for the book, but it is in the week5 js file.</p>

        </ul>


        <h2>Questions:</h2>

        <p>I do not have any questions this week.</p>



        <h2>Exercises:</h2>

        <h3>Exercise 1: Using asserts and Error message</h3>
        <p>THis exercise is simply testing things I found in the reading. I used a function to run a handful of test
            cases on another function,
            made a if block that checks the type of the input, and also have a function that will throw a specific error
            I create. To see the code
            more clearly, please visit the js folder under week5 and click on the week5.js file
            to see the code.</p>
